//Everything in js happens inside an Execution Context


//It has two components
// 1) Memory component(Variable environment) -> This us the place where all the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs
//2)Code component (Thread of execution) -> Here is the place where code is executed one line at a time

// JS is a synchronous single threaded language -> JS can only execute one command at a time in a specific order, it can only go to the next line  once the current line has been finished executing
